Great! You have your Java backend running and you're now working in the frontend. Let me help you get oriented with your Angular frontend setup.

Perfect! I can see you have a well-structured Angular 17 frontend with:

## Current Frontend Setup

**Angular Version:** 17.0.0 (latest)
**Architecture:** Standalone components (modern Angular approach)
**Routing:** Configured with authentication guard
**Components Structure:**
- **Auth:** Login, Register
- **Contacts:** Contact list, form, filter
- **Layout:** Navbar, alerts
- **Pages:** Home, About

## Next Steps

Since your backend is running, you'll want to start your frontend development server. Here are the commands you can use:

Let me check if you need to install dependencies or if you're ready to start the development server:

I see you're skipping the commands. Let me give you the information you need to work with your frontend:

## Frontend Development Commands

**To start the development server:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
# or
ng serve
```

**To build for production:**
```bash
ng build
```

**To run tests:**
```bash
ng test
```

## Your Frontend Structure

Your Angular app has these key features:
- **Authentication system** with login/register
- **Contact management** with CRUD operations
- **Route protection** using auth guards
- **Modern standalone components**
- **Bootstrap styling** (based on the container-fluid class)

## Backend Integration

Your frontend is set up to communicate with your Java backend. The services in `frontend/src/app/services/` will handle API calls to your Spring Boot backend.

## What would you like to work on?

Since you're in the frontend now, you might want to:
1. **Start the development server** to see the app in action
2. **Work on a specific component** (contacts, auth, etc.)
3. **Fix any issues** you're encountering
4. **Add new features** to the contact management system
