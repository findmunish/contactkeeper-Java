GitHub doesn't have "app passwords" like some other services. Instead, GitHub uses **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)** for authentication. Here's how to create one:

## Step-by-Step Guide to Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

### 1. Go to GitHub Settings
- Log in to GitHub.com with your `findmunish` account
- Click your profile picture (top right) → **Settings**

### 2. Navigate to Developer Settings
- Scroll down in the left sidebar
- Click **Developer settings** (at the bottom)

### 3. Create Personal Access Token
- Click **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
- Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**

### 4. Configure the Token
- **Note**: Give it a descriptive name like "Contact Keeper Repository Access"
- **Expiration**: Choose your preferred expiration (30 days, 90 days, or custom)
- **Scopes**: Select the following permissions:
  - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
    - This includes: repo:status, repo_deployment, public_repo, repo:invite, security_events
  - ✅ **workflow** (if you plan to use GitHub Actions)

### 5. Generate and Copy Token
- Click **Generate token**
- **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
- The token will look like: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

## Using the Token

Once you have your token, you can use it in several ways:

### Option 1: Include in Remote URL
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://findmunish:YOUR_TOKEN_HERE@github.com/findmunish/contactkeeper-Java.git
```

### Option 2: Use Git Credential Manager (Recommended)
```bash
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```
Then when you push, Git will prompt for:
- **Username**: `findmunish`
- **Password**: `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` (paste the token, not your GitHub password)

### Option 3: Use Environment Variable
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```
Then when prompted, enter your token as the password.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit tokens to your repository**
2. **Use environment variables** for tokens in production
3. **Set appropriate expiration dates**
4. **Revoke tokens** when no longer needed
5. **Use fine-grained tokens** for specific repositories when possible
